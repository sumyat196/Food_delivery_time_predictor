## Introduction

In the food delivery industry, accurately predicting delivery times is crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and optimizing delivery operations. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates delivery times based on various features such as weather conditions, road traffic density, delivery person information, etc. The model will help delivery companies improve their service efficiency and provide better customer experiences.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data Understanding

The dataset used for this project contains information about delivery orders including various features such as delivery person details, order date, weather conditions, road traffic density, etc.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, renaming columns, extracting relevant information, and converting data types to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. This may include extracting date features, calculating time differences, and deriving new variables based on domain knowledge.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and performing any necessary transformations to prepare the data for modeling.

## Modeling

Various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression are trained and evaluated to predict delivery times.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) Score.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by opening an issue to report bugs, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests with enhancements.
